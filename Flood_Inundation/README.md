## üìå Project Overview

This project leverages **Sentinel-1 SAR (C-band)** imagery and other geospatial datasets to detect floods and assess their impacts. The workflow:

- Creates **before-and-after flood mosaics**  
- Applies **slope filtering** and **connected pixel elimination** to refine flood extent  
- Calculates affected **cropland** and **built-up areas**  
- Generates an **interactive UI panel** for summary metrics  
- Exports results to **Google Drive** for further analysis

## üõ∞Ô∏è Data Used

- **Sentinel-1 GRD (COPERNICUS/S1_GRD)** ‚Äì C-band SAR imagery, VH polarization  
- **JRC Global Surface Water** ‚Äì Permanent water bodies  
- **WWF HydroSHEDS DEM** ‚Äì Terrain and slope masking  
- **ESA WorldCover v200** ‚Äì Land cover information  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Google Earth Engine (JavaScript API)**  
- SAR processing: mosaicking, median filtering, ratio computation  
- Flood mapping: thresholding, masking, connected pixel filtering  
- Impact assessment: cropland and built-up area calculation  
- UI Dashboard: GEE `ui.Panel` for displaying metrics

## üìä Features & Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Flood Detection
- Compute ratio of **after / before flood SAR backscatter**  
- Threshold ratio > 1.25 ‚Üí flood candidate pixels  
- Mask out **permanent water** and **steep slopes**  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Flood Refinement
- Eliminate **isolated pixels** using connected pixel thresholding  
- Apply **slope mask** (pixels < 5¬∞)  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Impact Assessment
- Intersect refined flood extent with **land cover**  
- Compute **flooded cropland** and **built-up areas** in hectares  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Interactive Dashboard
- Displays key statistics:
  - Flood timeline  
  - Estimated flood extent (ha)  
  - Flooded cropland (ha)  
  - Flooded built-up area (ha)  
- Lists datasets and project authorship
